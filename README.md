# Fruit-Quality-Detection
The quality of fruits and vegetables plays a crucial role in consumer consumption, thereby affecting sales. In India, a significant portion of the population relies on agricultural products. Businesses and organizations involved in making, displaying, and transporting these products need to check the quality of the fruit. Identifying the maturity of fresh fruit is beneficial for vendors who transport them, ensuring freshness through monitoring perishable goods and early detection of degradation, which prevents loss from wastage. Remote fruit monitoring from the field to the store can guarantee fruit quality. The quality of the fruit is continuously detected, and SMS alerts are sent to vendors. The effectiveness of the fruit quality monitoring process can be improved by recent technological breakthroughs such as Machine Learning (ML) and the Internet of Things (IoT). If defects are not detected, defective fruits may contaminate good fruits. We 
implemented this idea to help vendors reduce the loss due to rotten fruits. The proposed method applies the deep learning technique Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and classification of rotten fruits. CNNs are capable of automatically learning and extracting features from images of fruits, allowing for accurate identification and classification of fruit quality based on visual characteristics.
